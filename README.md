# simonrim-character-builds

Welcome to the [SimonRim Character Builds Wiki](https://github.com/rusalka9/simonrim-character-builds/wiki)! This is a community project for creating and sharing character builds for the [SimonRim suite of Skyrim mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746?tab=user+files) (Adamant, Mysticism, Thaumaturgy, etc.). If you're looking for a build for your next Skyrim playthrough or want to share a fun build with others, this is the place to do so!

Editing this wiki is open to anyone (with a free GitHub account)! You don't need to ask first, you can jump right into sharing your builds, tips and tricks, or mod recommendations. You can also post on the [Discussions](https://github.com/rusalka9/simonrim-character-builds/discussions) if you have a question or comment.

## Rules
1. **Be Respectful** - No harassment, racism, sexism, transphobia, or other hateful conduct. 
2. **Keep Things SFW** - Please keep all text, images, and other content embedded in wiki pages Safe for Work. You may link to NSFW mods/images on Nexus **so long as you clearly mark the links as NSFW**.
3. **Original Content Only** - You don't have to be the first person to think of playing a particular character archetype (which is probably impossible for a game as old as Skyrim) but it does mean that any character backstories, portraits, etc. should be original work. Don't copy a build directly from Reddit or YouTube, don't steal someone's artwork, and [don't post AI-generated content](https://www.creativebloq.com/features/what-can-stop-generative-ai-art).
4. **Edit Responsibly** - Don't "fix" someone else's build, mess with the overall structure of the wiki, edit these rules, etc. If you want to make significant changes to this wiki, you can fork the repository. If you want to give feedback on a build, ask a question, point out a typo, or suggest changes, use the [Discussions](https://github.com/rusalka9/simonrim-character-builds/discussions).
5. **Use English** - It's fine if your English isn't great! But for moderation purposes, please stick to English.

Breaking these rules will get you blocked from the repository, so don't be a jerk!
